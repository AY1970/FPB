        <h2>Types of Financial Planning Models</h2>
        <p>Published on May 3, 2023</p>
      </header>
 </header>
  <p>So far, we’ve spoken mainly about financial planning models that encompass the whole business, but there are
    several subtypes of financial model examples that might be used in different scenarios. These include:</p>
  <p><strong>Project Financial Modelling:</strong> Unlike financial planning models that are based on data and
    assumptions about your whole business, project-based financial modeling is based on a single (usually large)
    project. All of the same financial data modeling input and data apply, but it’s all specific to the project
    itself. So, instead of your accounting records, you might use your estimating for the project to set up certain
    elements of this financial model example.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing Models:</strong> The past couple of years has been volatile – to say the least – when it comes to
    pricing. Labor shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and more have created a perfect storm. Using financial data
    about your business to build pricing models that you can update quickly and easily – or that you can use to run
    various pricing scenarios before you choose what you plan to do – is a great way to stay on top of pricing in a
    challenging marketplace.</p>
  <p><strong>Three-Way Financial Models:</strong> Three-way financial models, or integrated financial statement models
    as they are also known, are the financial planning models you’re most likely to know and recognize. This financial
    model example draws data from your income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet to create a snapshot of
    present and past performance. Your financial planner and analyst can then use this data to make assumptions about
    the future based on a range of scenarios. Taking the time to build financial models so you can test different
    approaches to your business removes some of the risks in making big decisions. Because you can use financial data
    modeling to try different approaches before you commit, you can choose the approach that has the greatest likelihood
    of success.</p>
  <p><strong>Reporting Models:</strong> Unlike financial models that are for planning for the future, reporting models
    are more focused on what is actually happening now. Often, current data will be compared to previous years so that
    you can verify that your business is growing at the rate you expected.</p>
  <p><strong>Long-Term Financial Planning Model:</strong> Financial planning models can be for the short term, medium
    term, or long term. Most companies create financial model examples for each of these time frames so that they can
    get the complete picture from their financial data. Long-term financial planning models might be useful when you
    are planning an exit strategy for a company by giving you an idea of what the company might be valued at a fixed
    point in the future. Long-term financial data modeling can also help to decide if accessing a large amount of
    financing now might be the right decision and how it might affect your financial situation in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples of Financial Planning Models:</strong> Now that you know what financial planning models are, you
    might be wondering how you can use them for your business. One example might be if you are looking for a business
    partner or investor. They will probably want to know not only what your business has done so far but what you expect
    to happen in the future. Another example of a financial model and how it can be used for strategizing is if you
    want to invest in new equipment for your business. A financial planning model will help you to weigh the cost, the
    return on investment, and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Strategic and Financial Planning Models and Principles:</strong> All financial planning models are based on a
    mix of known figures (budgets, income, expenses, and so on) and predictions and assumptions. It’s important that
    those assumptions are based on realistic possibilities. For instance, if you have steadily had 5 to 7% growth for
    a few years, changing that to 10% without making corresponding changes in your business will be a big red flag –
    particularly if you are building a financing model for a bank or lender.</p>
